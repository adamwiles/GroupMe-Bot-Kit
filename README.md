# GroupMe-Bot-Kit
A GroupMe api wrapper that combined with node js allows for easy creation and use of GroupMe bots.
This wrapper can create a bot and send a message in 3 lines of code, with an access token and a
group id. Access tokens and group ids can be found on the GroupMe developer website.

#Creating a Bot
Creating a new bot requires only a name, but a group id is required to register the bot and send
messages to a group. The bot also has options for an avatar, profile picture, and a callback URL.
The callback url will recieve a copy of all group messages.
